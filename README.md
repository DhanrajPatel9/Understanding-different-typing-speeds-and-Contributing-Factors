# Understanding-different-typing-speeds-and-Contributing-Factors

In this study, 40 students students were tasked with preformed three trails of a typing test on both and
phone and keyboard and answer a series of questions relating to their typing abilities. Using this data this
study investigated its primary research question of which typing method resulted in a faster typing speed. It
was found that on average using a keyboard resulted in much faster typing speed compared to phones. In
addition, the study also analyzed which quantitative and qualitative factors most influence typing speeds on
phones and keyboards. To accomplish this linear regression was utilized with mean typing scores used as a
response variable for both phones and keyboards. To conclude, for keyboard typing it was found that being
a gamer significantly increased the participantâ€™s typing speed and age and if the participant was injured
significantly decreased typing speeds. While for phones we found that having a smaller phone screen size,
having high typing accuracy, having a apple device as apposed to an android device, being fluent in English
and being a gamer significantly improved typing speeds on phones.
